/**
 * End-to-end tests that need more than one runtime or more than one CLI run:
 * per-ecosystem isolation on a polyglot tree, cross-runtime equality of the
 * report's `overall` block, and the restricted-permission proof that a denied
 * probe degrades evidence instead of lying about a missing tool.
 *
 * This file spawns node, deno and bun CLIs directly, so it is held back from
 * the Bun and Deno suites (see contrib/alt-runtime-tests.js).
