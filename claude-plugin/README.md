# OWASP cdxgen plugin for Claude Code

Brings the [OWASP cdxgen](https://cdxgen.github.io/cdxgen) toolkit into Claude
Code as a set of Agent Skills. Claude picks the right skill from your request,
then drives the correct cdxgen command with the right flags — including the
safety constraints that keep an agent from installing packages or leaking
secrets on your behalf.

## Install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add cdxgen/cdxgen
claude plugin install cdxgen@cdxgen-plugins
```

Then run `/reload-plugins` if the install summary asks you to.

## Prerequisites

The plugin ships instructions, not the tool. Install cdxgen itself:

```bash
npm i -g @cdxgen/cdxgen
```

| Requirement | Detail                                                            |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Node.js     | >= 24                                                             |
| Java        | Only on jar-based atom triples (darwin-amd64, windows-arm64, linux-arm64-musl): >= 23 |
| Container   | `ghcr.io/cdxgen/cdxgen:master` — build tools preinstalled         |

Optional enrichment: `@cdxgen/cdxgen-plugins-bin` (Trivy, osquery, `golem`,
`trustinspector`) and `@cdxgen/cdx-hbom` (hardware collection).

| `sbom-fidelity-loop`       | Raise a shallow SBOM to a fully resolved one via `--profile introspect`             |
| `bom-slimmer`              | Shrink dependency footprint using SBOM evidence and license risk                    |

Invoke one directly as `/cdxgen:sbom-generate`, or just describe what you want
and let Claude select.

## Safety posture

Every skill loads [reference/safety.md](reference/safety.md), which encodes the
constraints that matter when an agent runs cdxgen:

- **Dry-run first.** `--dry-run --activity-report json`, summarize, then ask before executing for real.
- **Never auto-install dependencies.** `--install-deps` defaults on; the skills steer to `--no-install-deps` or `--lifecycle pre-build` in CI and containers.
- **Absolute paths only.** Relative paths break the external build tools cdxgen invokes.
- **Never hand-write purls.** A plausible-looking invented purl silently poisons downstream matching.
- **Never surface raw Golem values.** Data-flow output can contain the secrets it found; review through `cdx:golem:*` counts and categories instead.
- **Confirm before publishing.** Uploads to Dependency-Track or TEA are outward-facing actions.
- **Credentials stay out of the transcript.** API keys and signing keys go through the environment, never a pasted value.

Atom's Java failure mode is called out wherever it applies: on the jar-based
triples (darwin-amd64, windows-arm64, linux-arm64-musl), Java below 23 makes
C/C++/Python/CBOM scans freeze or return thin BOMs rather than erroring.
Native-binary platforms need no JDK at all.

## Development

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./claude-plugin
claude plugin validate ./claude-plugin
```

Run `/reload-plugins` after edits rather than restarting.

The `sbom-fidelity-loop` and `bom-slimmer` skills are copies; `.agents/skills/`
in the repository root is their source of truth. Update them there first, then
sync.
